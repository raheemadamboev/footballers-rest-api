KTOR REST API to give random football players with image and data

**Footballers**

I love KTOR! This is basic backend server built by KTOR framework. It has only one route which gives data about random footballer. I created this project to get start with KTOR framework and I also connected it to Android app <a href="https://github.com/raheemadamboev/random-footballer">Random Footballers.<a/>
